          Last choice: <strong>Wake him up and force him into the car to go to the hospital. Maybe it was something you ate or a bug going around, but you both have problems from whatever it was.​</strong>
        </p>
        <hr class="hr">
        <p class="story-info">"Alright,” you mutter to yourself. You crouch down in front of Nathan and poke him in the side. He groans softly. “Wake up, now. We’re going to the hospital.” You grab his shoulder and shake him firmly. “Come on, time to
          get up.”</p>

        <p class="story-info">Nathan rolls with every shake, and you don’t stop shaking him until he finally opens his eyes. They’re still gray.</p>

        <p class="story-info">“Wh-What’s going on?” Nathan whispers. He looks at you, confused, and then on the ground. “Did I fall asleep in your room?”</p>

        <p class="story-info">There’s not much you think you can say that won’t freak him out, so you just help him sit up.</p>

        <p class="story-info">“Is… Is that my blood?”</p>

        <p class="story-info">“Come on, time to get up. We need help.”</p>

        <p class="story-info">“I don’t feel good enough to drive.”</p>

        <p class="story-info">You jingle his keys that you found. “Let’s get up.”</p>

        <p class="story-info">Nathan obliges, still trying to process everything. You swing his arm over your shoulder and walk him towards the front door. “I had the strangest dream, you’ll never believe it.”</p>

        <p class="story-info">Fortunately, it seems that just the simple walk is helping Nathan regain his strength, and you can feel him letting up on your shoulder. You lock the door quickly behind you as you both leave and usher your brother into
          the passenger seat as quickly as you can, then take your place in the driver’s seat.</p>

        <p class="story-info">“You bit me.”</p>

        <p class="story-info">“I—“ you begin to protest.</p>

        <p class="story-info">“In my dream. You were almost <em>zombiem</em> like, groaning and snapping. You bit me, and I kicked your ass.”</p>

        <p class="story-info">You turn onto the main road outside your neighborhood onto an empty street. The hospital is still a few miles away. You debate only briefly between telling him everything in that time, or letting him continue thinking it
          was a dream. “It wasn’t a dream,” you finally say.</p>

        <p class="story-info">Nathan laughs. “You’re an idiot. There’s no way that was real.”</p>

        <p class="story-info">“I vomited blood this morning then I attacked you. I didn’t want to, but I couldn’t stop. Then you passed out in my room and vomited blood, too. That’s why we’re going to the hospital.”</p>

        <p class="story-info">“That’s not funny.”</p>

        <p class="story-info">“If it was a joke, I wouldn’t be driving.”</p>

        <p class="story-info">Nathan turns away from you and looks out the window, his favorite move when he’s done talking to you. Just looking the other way.</p>

        <p class="story-info">You pull up to a stop light and notice something very strange. “Hey, Nathan.”</p>

        <p class="story-info">No response. Real mature.</p>

        <p class="story-info">“Nathan. Tell me what you see.”</p>

        <p class="story-info">“It’s a traffic light. What do you want?”</p>

        <p class="story-info">“Notice anything weird about this?”</p>

        <p class="story-info">Nathan turns to you. “I really don’t want to play this game right now. What are you saying?”</p>

        <p class="story-info">“I’m saying it’s 3 p.m. on a Thursday during a busy school year, less than a mile from the college, and there’s no one out here. No cars. No people.” You realize that you haven’t seen a single person since you left the
          apartment, either.</p>

        <p class="story-info">The light turns green and you drive through the intersection, both you and Nathan looking out for any sign of life. You’re reminded of that feeling you had this morning that you were in a cheesy B movie. What was that
          film you were watching the other night with empty streets? You can’t remember the name. You move slowly down the street. In the back of your mind, you remember where you’re headed, but it’s not so important anymore.</p>

        <p class="story-info">“Help!” A piercing shriek shakes through the windows, and you wince at the octave. A young woman, probably a college student, bolts from the front door of the house three doors down from you. She looks back and forth on
          the street, seemingly coming to the same realization that no one is around, before noticing you. She jumps up and down, waving her hands towards you. “Help!” she cries again.</p>

        <p class="story-info">You don’t have time to respond. Your body once again has decided to exile you and, as its first act, slams your foot on the pedal towards this woman.​</p>

        <p class="story-info"><em>Not again.</em></p>

        <p class="story-info">You can’t move your head, but you can tell that Nathan is locked in position as well, but you can’t decide if it’s because he can’t, like you, or because he can’t believe that you are about to run this girl over.</p>

        <p class="story-info">As you get closer, the woman realizes what’s happening and turns to run, just before your front bumper runs into her legs, and she collapses to the ground. You feel the bumps underneath you as you drive over her and
          she’s now behind you. You hit the breaks and climb out of the car, and you can see in your peripheral that Nathan is doing the same thing.</p>

        <p class="story-info">The woman is lying on the ground, sobbing, one of her legs snapped and bleeding, her face covered in grime from the bottom of the car and blood from several scrapes. You crouch down so your face is in hers and, right
          before your hand touches her face, you hear growling coming from the house she ran from.</p>

        <p class="story-info">You’re not able to look up, only at your hand at it violently reaches into her eye socket, while six new hands grab around you, pulling at her arms and chest. Your fingers squeeze into the socket, two above and the thumb
          below, and pressure the eye out.</p>

        <p class="story-info">Trapped in your own body, you make a mental note to vomit later as you pop the eyeball into your mouth and crunch down. You almost wish you could taste the eye, only to distract you from the screams. You lean in to her
          face and bite down on her cheek.</p>

        <p class="story-info"><em>What the hell are you, a caveman!?</em></p>

        <p class="story-info">As you pull back away, you see a smudge on her face through the blood and tears where your nose wiped through. Fantastic.</p>

        <p class="story-info">You chew for quite some time on the piece of cheek as another person, not Nathan, goes in for another bite of her face. You think you recognize him from English 200 last year. He rips off a piece from where you bit down
          and shovels it in to his mouth.</p>

        <p class="story-info">The screams die down and the woman stops moving. You swallow the last bit and lean backwards, finding the soft ground with your bottom and sit. The others do the same.</p>

        <p class="story-info">You let out a sigh of relief that you’ve finally stopped, and breathe another sigh of relief because you realize that you actually can again. You put your hands on your forehead and then hear Nathan vomiting next to you.
        </p>

        <p class="story-info">You turn to the guy you think you recognize from class. He seems to have control of himself, and it particularly annoyed with the situation. You decide this isn’t the first time it’s happened to him, either.​</p>

        <p class="story-info">There’s no chance you’re going to the hospital now. You’re pretty sure now that this isn’t something modern science can fix.</p>

        <p class="story-info">“I have questions,” Nathan heaves, before vomiting again.</p>

        <p class="story-info">“I have answers,” the other man answers. You don’t recognize this one at all. “Come inside, before… <em>that</em> happens again.”​</p>

        <p class="story-info">Do you:</p>

        <p class="story-info">1) ​Follow Nathan into the house. He deserves his answers, and it seems these people know more about what’s going on.​</p>

        <p class="story-info">2) Refuse, and move on. They seem a little too calm about the whole thing, and you don’t trust them.</p>
